Release Notes: This was my first experience writing a GUI desktop application and it was a good way learn Java, obviously this was a very shoddy attempt but hopefully someone can make it better or give me directions in what they want to see.
Obviously plenty of stuff in here is broken you can see how it used to work on http://scrape.it but I've abandoned this Screen Scraper gui for a newer project. As of now, this depends on the JxBrowser library which is commercial, is not included.
